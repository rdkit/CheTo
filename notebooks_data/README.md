## New experiments with CheTo

In a recently published book chapter we are describing a set of different experiments using chemical topic modeling to dive deeper into the data in ChEMBL23. In this folder you can find the notebooks to create the results/images in the book chapter cited below. They should inspire you how CheTo can be used to explore chemical data sets.
